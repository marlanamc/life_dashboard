## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn
- (Optional) Pipedream account for TickTick integration

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd life-dashboard
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

### Optional: Firebase Cloud Sync

1. Create a Firebase project and enable Firestore (in native mode).
2. In **Build â†’ Authentication**, enable the **Email/Password** sign-in provider. (Anonymous sign-in is optional.)
3. Add a web app in Firebase to obtain your Firebase config object.
4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and populate the following variables:

   ```bash
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-app.firebaseapp.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-app.appspot.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
   # Optional if you plan to use the Realtime Database API
   VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your-app.firebaseio.com
   ```

5. Restart the dev server so Vite picks up the new environment variables.

With Firebase configured, the dashboard will prompt you to sign in. Once authenticated, your brain dump items and projects sync to Firestore while still caching everything locally for offline use.

### Using the Built-in Login

- Launch `npm run dev` and open the dashboard â€” the auth overlay guides you through sign in or account creation.
- Use the **Sign up** tab to register a new account (email + password). We store the profile in Firebase Auth.
- After signing in, the account chip in the top-right shows the active user and offers a **Log out** button.
- When you sign out, everything remains locally so you can keep working offline until you sign in again.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory.

### Install as an App

The dashboard is now a Progressive Web App. After starting the dev server or opening the production build:

1. Visit the site in Chrome, Edge, or another PWA-capable browser.
2. Open the browser menu and choose **Install Life Dashboard** (or the install icon in the address bar).
3. Launch the installed app from your dock/launcher for a distraction-free, standalone experience.

Offline support keeps the core interface and theme assets available even when you lose connectivity.

## ðŸ”— Integrations

### TickTick Integration

The dashboard includes built-in TickTick integration for task synchronization:

- **Sync Capacity Tasks**: Send tasks from your capacity planner to TickTick
- **Sync Brain Dump**: Convert brain dump items to TickTick tasks
- **Real-time Updates**: View your TickTick lists and task counts

**Setup Options:**
1. **Pipedream (Recommended)**: Bypass CORS restrictions with a proxy workflow
2. **Direct Integration**: Limited due to browser CORS restrictions

**Quick Start:**
- See `PIPEDREAM_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for complete setup instructions
- Use `test-pipedream-integration.html` to test your configuration
- Check `TICKTICK_INTEGRATION.md` for detailed integration docs
